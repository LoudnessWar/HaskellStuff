{-My approach to this is that of a hashmap, I first sort x y and z for least to greatest then I just assign each of the Values to A B and C and rearange A B and C to whatever
the order is and then return them

This was my first time running into maybe nothing and Just, I am not really sure what it does and how it works\

{-in the rearrange function I ran into an error where everything was outputterd with maybe and nothing
I learned that I need to use just to get rid of the maybe wrapper
